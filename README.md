# Next.js Skeleton Image Loading Demo

This is a minimal demo showcasing a skeleton loading state for images in Next.js, built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Skeleton loading state while images load
- Smooth fade-in transition
- Priority loading for important images
- Responsive grid layout
- Built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Demo

https://github.com/[your-username]/skeleton-images-next-js/assets/[your-id]/demo.mp4

The demo shows the skeleton loading effect with a 1.5 second delay for demonstration purposes.

## Implementation Details

The demo uses two main components:

- `Skeleton`: A simple animated loading placeholder
- `FadeInImage`: A wrapper component that shows a skeleton state while the image loads

The implementation is lightweight and can be easily integrated into any Next.js project.
